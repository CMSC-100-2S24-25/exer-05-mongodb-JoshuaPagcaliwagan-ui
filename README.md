## Code Description 
This project is a simple user management using Express, Mongoose, Needle, and MongoDB. We have 4 js files namely controller.js (main logic file), router.js (for routes), server.js (for connection), and test.js (for testing cases. The code uses various concepts relating to MongoDB, Express, and Node, such as needle, .post, res.body, app.use, app.listen, router, export default, mongoose.connect, res.send, .save, .updateOne, .deleteOne, .deleteMany,  and .find.

## How to Use  
Using the test.js file, choose which function you want to run. We have a total of six function, you can choose to save students into your MongoDB, update info about a student using their student number, delete a student using their student number, delete all students, get student based on their student number, and get all students. You can check your MongoDB to see the changes.
